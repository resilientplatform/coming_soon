# Resilient AI — Coming Soon Page

Welcome to the first public footprint of **Resilient AI™**, a human-first leadership platform powered by artificial intelligence—and grounded in emotional clarity, sustainable delivery, and trust.

This repository contains the initial **Flask-based landing page**, designed to introduce the mission and collect early support as we prepare for launch.

## 🌱 What is Resilient AI?

**Resilient AI** is not just a product. It's a platform and a movement.  
We're building AI not to replace people—but to empower them.

In an era of toxic urgency and ego-driven leadership, we're redefining what it means to build software teams, lead with care, and design cultures that work for people, not against them.

> "Where AI empowers people — not replaces them."
